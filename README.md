# TrustedGateway: TEE-Assisted Routing and Firewall Enforcement Using ARM TrustZone

Main files of the TrustedGateway (TruGW) prototype.
We are currently working on preparing the full release of the prototype including all necessary build files and documentation.

The corresponding research paper has been accepted for publication and is going to appear in the proceedings of the 25th International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses ([RAID'22](https://raid2022.cs.ucy.ac.cy/)).
It will soon be available in the CISPA Publications Database (https://cispa.de/en/research/publications) and the ACM Digital Library (https://dl.acm.org/).

The license of this project is still not determined, but will likely be (L)GPLv2.
There might be licensing differences regarding some of the subcomponents.

At the moment, the whole project is still under a restrictive/no license.
