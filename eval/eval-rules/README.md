# Sample Firewall Rules for Evaluation/Testing

## *Warning:*
Sometimes we observed a crash on policy submission via ConfigService's web application.
Also, sometimes our connection to ConfigService got locked out for a while.
We are not sure yet why those things have sometimes happened in the past.

Note: Policy submissions from Safari seem to have caused less crashes in our setup than from Chrome.
